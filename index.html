        Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. 
        He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha 
        throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while 
        chasing his dream to become Hokage.

                    Boruto Uzumaki (うずまきボルト, Uzumaki Boruto) is a shinobi from Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan and a direct descendant
                     of the Hyūga clan through his mother. While initially resentful of his father and his absence since becoming Hokage,
                     Boruto eventually comes to respect his father and duties. Regardless, he vows to instead become a shinobi like his mentor.
